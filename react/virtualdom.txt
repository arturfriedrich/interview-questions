What is the difference between the Virtual DOM and the "real" DOM?
React updates the Virtual DOM instead of the "real" DOM, and then syncs with the "real" DOM with "react-dom". Looks at the differences and just updates that individual part of the "real" DOM.

Is the Virtual DOM the same as the Shadow DOM?
No, that's a separate browser-specific technology.
